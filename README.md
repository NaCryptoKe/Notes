All my **class notes, slides, and mind maps** because, let's be honest, my handwriting is a crime against humanity. 📝

### 🎓 Assignments
A mix of "Wow, I actually understood this!" and "What is even happening?" 

### 🚀 Projects
Code, presentations, and last-minute caffeine-fueled miracles. ☕

### 🤯 Exam Reviews
A collection of panic-induced study guides that may or may not contain actual knowledge. 

### 🎭 Random Thoughts
Brainstorms, wild ideas, and the occasional rant about professors who assign 200 pages of reading overnight. 📚😩

### 🤡 Memes
Because college is hard, and laughter is free therapy. 😂
